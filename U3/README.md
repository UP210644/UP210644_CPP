# Test

- Player1 is X
- Player2 is O
- (This is an example of player versus player)
</div align="center">

The first thing will be the terminal showing which game mode you want to play
<img src="U3/../imagenes/Gato 1.PNG"/>

Game mode 1 is selected to play against the computer, in the table you can use the numbers from 1 to 9
<img src="U3/../imagenes/Gato 2.PNG"/>

My first move is cell 1, the computer as you can see is cell 5
<img src="U3/../imagenes/Gato 3.PNG"/>  

My next move is cell 4, the one on the computer as you can see is cell 7
<img src="U3/../imagenes/Gato 4.PNG"/>  

My third move is on cell 7 to prevent the computer from winning. The PC counters by putting his move in cell 3 to prevent me from winning.

# Conclusion

This work helped me to know and reinforce my knowledge of programming, it was entertaining to program this work but it was also very difficult for the part of artificial intelligence. I had to investigate on the internet how to improve my program so that it was the best possible.The artificial intelligence was the most cost me since it gave me error after error but in the end I was able to get what I wanted.
