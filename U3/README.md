# Test
</div align="center">

The first thing that appears on the screen is a menu to choose the game mode.  
<img src="../imagenes/gato1.png" align="center">  
Select 1 since we are going to play vs. the PC. The game board will appear with numbers from 1 to 9 to select the move.   
<img src="../imagenes/gato2.png" align="center">  
Now we will start playing against the PC, my first move is on cell 5. On the other hand, the PC's first move is always random.  
<img src="../imagenes/gato3.png" align="center">  
My second move is on cell 9. The computer now counters by placing its move on cell 1.   
<img src="../imagenes/gato4.png" align="center">  
My third move is on cell 7 to prevent the computer from winning. The PC counters by putting his move in cell 3 to prevent me from winning.
<img src="../imagenes/gato5.png" align="center">  
My fourth move is in cell 8. The CP counters by putting their move in cell 8 to prevent me from winning.  
<img src="../imagenes/gato6.png" align="center">  
As the cells ran out, the game ended in a draw.

# Conclusion

This work helped me to know and reinforce my knowledge of programming, it was entertaining to program this work but it was also very difficult for the part of artificial intelligence. I had to investigate on the internet how to improve my program so that it was the best possible.The artificial intelligence was the most cost me since it gave me error after error but in the end I was able to get what I wanted.
