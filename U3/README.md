- Player2 is O
- (This is an example of player versus player)
</div align="center">

Game mode 1 is selected to play against the computer, in the table you can use the numbers from 1 to 9

# Conclusion

This work helped me to know and reinforce my knowledge of programming, it was entertaining to program this work but it was also very difficult for the part of artificial intelligence. I had to investigate on the internet how to improve my program so that it was the best possible.The artificial intelligence was the most cost me since it gave me error after error but in the end I was able to get what I wanted.
